"Build Team Workflow" should be "Build a Composition"
Build/Evaluate/Criteria should all be removed/combined.
Setup should clearly indicate (via ui and/or explicit text) that champion slots can be filled in either fully (to get composition analysis), partially (to get composition suggestions), or not at all (for composition building)
This should allow a consolidation of Validate/Inspect potentially
Active Team should be a selection item and default to the default set in Team Context.
The status banner either needs to add provable value or be removed
"Build a Composition" should be used to explain the "Fill all slots..." variety options
"Fill all slots..." and other line entry items should then be removed from the Setup tab.
Apply Recommended Preset and Open Team Context should both be removed
"Active team context: " is redundant
"Team mode: " also redundant
Examine the UI approach of having 5 players in 3 rows. Would it not be better to match "Node Draft Order" visually?
